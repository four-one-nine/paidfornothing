# A Simple App for when you're getting paid to not work

Hi! If you're reading this, you may be wondering what this app exists for. Here's a little story!

There was a period of time I was doing an internship at a company during school. Due to an issue with my co-worker's and my own onboarding process, we didn't have any computer. This was a problem because the responsbilities of the job were 100% on the computer, meaning that we couldn't do our job. Our supervisor told us to "Make it look like we're doing something" while we waited for this issue to get sorted out. So my co-worker and I brought in our own personal laptops and programmed this app onto an Arduino. The idea being simple - we were being paid to sit at our desks and do nothing. Years later, as I decided I wanted to venture into learning some of the basics of React, I made this!
