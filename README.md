# A Simple App for when you're getting paid to not work

This app is a simple app that I built as a way to learn some of the basics of React. 

The premise is simple- If you get paid to not really do anything, this is for you! Just input your salary and press start, then the counter will tell you just how much money you've been paid today to sit around and not work!
